Main files
    modelLinearPixels.py
        calculates linear regression weights on the pixel values.

    modelLinearHCFeatures.py
        Calculates the linear regression on the handcrafted feature vectors
        Some features contain categorical data. With the function featureVectorToDummyVariables() are dummy variables created for the categories in order for linear regression to work.license

Used by the main files
    create_data.py
        class which loads the dataset and splits it into training data and testing data
        class also supports augmentation of the data

    HCFeatures.py 
        is the class with all handcrafted features. The class is used by:
            modelLinearHCFeatures.py
            modelDecisionTree.py
            plottingAndTestingFeaturesAndRegression.py
        With initializing the class it attempts loading the mixture of Gaussians model from the mogModel folder. 
        The class supports training the prototype matching feature and the mixture of Gaussians model.
        With the function predict(predictX), the feature vector of a data point is calculated and returned.

Optional
    plottingAndTestingFeaturesAndRegression.py
        Was used to test features and create the plots for in the report
