Main files
    linearRegressionPixels.py
        calculates linear regression weights on the pixel values.

    linearRegressionHCFeatures.py
        Calculates the linear regression on the handcrafted feature vectors
        Some features contain categorical data. With the function featureVectorToDummyVariables() are dummy variables created for the categories in order for linear regression to work.license


Used by the main files
create_data.py
- class which loads the dataset and splits it into training data and testing data
- Class also supports augmentation of the data



HCFeatures.py 
- is the class with all handcrafted features. The class is used by:
    - linearRegressionHCFeatures.py
    - plottingAndTestingFeaturesAndRegression.py
    - decisionTree
- With initializing the class it attempts loading the mixture of Gaussians model from the mogModel folder. 
- The class supports training the prototype matching feature and the mixture of Gaussians model.
- With the function predict(predictX), the feature vector of a data point is calculated and returned.

Optional
plottingAndTestingFeaturesAndRegression.py:
- Was used to test features and create the plots for in the report

ToDo:
split linear regression on pixels from featureParameterPipeline
split linear regression on HC features from featureParameterPipeline
